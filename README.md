# Hide and Seek with Rat
It's a Hide and Seek Game with a Rat. You will enjoy playing this game. 
I also programmed this game when I was learning C language.

# Rules of the Game:
1. There are three holes. A rat is hidden in one of those three holes.
2. The Rat shuffles its position every time.
3. You have to guess the hole in which the Rat is hidden among the three holes.
4. The hole in which Rat is present is named as ‘R’ and rest two are named as ‘N’.
5. You have some cash(inhand_cash) with you.
6. You make a bet (amount_bet) for playing this game every time you make a guess.
7. If your guess is wrong, you loose the amount_bet from your inhand_cash.
8. If you guess is right, you win twice the amount_bet in your inhand_cash.
9. Keep playing and keep winning until you go out of cash.
